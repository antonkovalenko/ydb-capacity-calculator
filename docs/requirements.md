# YDB capacity calculator

## Terms

Specific terms used in stories below are:

- cluster – A YDB cluster consists of [storage](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#storage-node) and [database](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#database-node) nodes. As the data stored in YDB is available only via queries and API calls, both types of nodes are essential for [database availability](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/topology#database-availability). However, [distributed storage](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#distributed-storage) consisting of storage nodes has the most impact on the cluster's fault tolerance and ability to persist data reliably. During the initial cluster deployment, an appropriate distributed storage [operating mode](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/topology#cluster-config) needs to be chosen according to the expected workload and [database availability](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/topology#database-availability)requirements. The operation mode cannot be changed after the initial cluster setup, making it one of the key decisions to consider when planning a new YDB deployment.
- **Database nodes** (also known as **tenant nodes** or **compute nodes**) serve user queries addressed to a specific logical [database](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#database). Their state is only in memory and can be recovered from the [Distributed Storage](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#distributed-storage). All database nodes of a given [YDB cluster](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/topology) can be considered its compute layer. Thus, adding database nodes and allocating extra CPU and RAM to them are the main ways to increase the database's compute resources.
- **Storage nodes** are stateful and responsible for long-term persisting pieces of data. All storage nodes of a given [YDB cluster](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#cluster) are called [Distributed Storage](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#distributed-storage) and can be considered the cluster's storage layer. Thus, adding extra storage nodes and their disks are the main ways to increase the cluster's storage capacity and input/output throughput.
  Storage group – A **storage group**, **Distributed storage group**, or **Blob storage group** is a location for reliable data storage similar to [RAID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID), but using disks of multiple servers. Depending on the chosen [cluster topology](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#topology), storage groups use different algorithms to ensure high availability, similar to [standard RAID levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels). - Physically, a group is a set of multiple physical devices (OS block devices) located on different nodes, so that the failure of one device correlates as little as possible with the failure of another device. These devices are usually located in different racks or datacenters. On each of these devices, some space is allocated for the group, which is managed by a special service called VDisk. Each VDisk runs on top of a block storage device, from which it is separated by another service called PDisk.
  A group can be treated as a set of VDisks
- [Distributed storage](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#distributed-storage) typically manages a large number of relatively small storage groups. Each group can be assigned to a specific [database](https://ydb.tech/docs/en/concepts/glossary#database) to increase disk capacity and input/output throughput available to this database.

## Non-functional

Since all the logic might be calculated in JavaScript on the client I need this project to be done as a single HTML page with logic in javascript. Look and feel of a modern standard UI library would suffice.
