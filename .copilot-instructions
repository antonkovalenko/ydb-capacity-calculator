# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Context

This is a client-side capacity planning tool for YDB database clusters. All logic runs in the browser using vanilla JavaScript.

## Code Style Preferences

- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript features
- Prefer const/let over var
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Write self-documenting function names
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Mobile-first responsive CSS
- No external dependencies (vanilla JS only)

## Key Business Logic

- Calculate servers needed based on CPU cores and storage requirements
- Handle YDB-specific concepts: storage groups, database nodes, storage nodes
- Account for system resource reservations
- Support both greenfield planning and existing infrastructure analysis

## When generating code

1. Always validate inputs
2. Handle edge cases gracefully
3. Use clear variable names that reflect YDB terminology
4. Include helpful error messages
5. Make UI responsive and accessible
6. Add comments explaining business logic
